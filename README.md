# PowUnity Apple Shortcuts
This repository contains three Apple Shortcuts that can be used to interact with PowUnity's BikeTrax API.

## Usage
Import the three shortcuts into your Apple Shortcuts app. Then, log in to the [BikeTrax App](https://app.powunity.com/) copy your API credentials, and update the links in the shortcuts accordingly.
The API credentials are in the BikeTrax App under `Cog icon (settings) > Advanced Settings`.

## Automations
To turn on automation, like automatically arming the bike at a certain time, you'll need to use the Shortcut app on an iOS or iPadOS device.

## Localization
The Shortcuts titles and messages are written in English, but I suggest you translate them to the language you use on your device.
The interaction will be more natural, and you can use the shortcut titles as Siri commands.
